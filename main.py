"""

Create a tracker for expenses, 
for that i need to get user input for each expense
where the user can input:
    1- Expense Name.
    2- Amount.
    3- Description.
    4- Date.

After the user inputs expenses, the app shows all the expenses,
the view should be in a table format and, and at the last row, 
show the total amount of all the expenses.


This app will be CLi based, and then made GUI with Tkinter

To save the expenses,  will use a simple txt file as DB.
and each line will contain 1 expense

Basically I must create a CLi CRUD for the app.
